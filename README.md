- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shadyshift
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding/hacking/just fun things 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning linux and python
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: in the issues of a project
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: i don't care, be creative:)
- âš¡ Fun fact: many I am a bit boring...  let me think about it.

Ok, now I am a shitty script kid tbh... But I will try to become an ethical hacker. This GitHub account? just for fun :). Just another dead GitHub account.(I use Debian btw) <--- bad joke
